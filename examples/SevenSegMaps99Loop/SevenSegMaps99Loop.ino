/*
SevenSeg99Loop.ino

Cycles 00 through 99, using the seven segment maps character write() method 
supplied in the SevenSegmentSL1255Lite class, repeatedly.

Demonstrates the methods:
  begin();
  write(int);

If you're unsure which pins to use to connect the seven segment display to on your
Arduino model, check the readme that came with this package or the documentation 
at https://github.com/greenonline/

This example code is in the public domain.
