/*
SevenSegMapsLoop.ino

Cycles through the ASCII character set (codes 32 to 127), using the seven 
segment maps character digit2CharWrite(), digit1CharWrite() and
digit0CharWrite(), methods supplied in the SevenSegmentSL1255Lite class, repeatedly.

Demonstrates the methods:
  begin();
  xfill();
  fillx();
  digit2CharWrite(int);
  digit1CharWrite(int);
  digit0CharWrite(int);

If you're unsure which pins to use to connect the seven segment display to on your
Arduino model, check the readme that came with this package or the documentation 
at https://github.com/greenonline/

This example code is in the public domain.
